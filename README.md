in 2021 made a small company with friend (i got fired after year cuz im too lazy to do all projects lmao)
in summer 2022 i made a database for a cafe site with my friend
in february 2023 my friend told me abt linux, and i tried it(first 2 attempts of using linux was terrible)
at the end of 2023 i do 3rd attempt for linux, and, luckily, i loved it so much(thanks, qugalet)
now im using arch with tiling manager, that i hated after my bad expirience with i3wm
upd: im currently using windows because of stupid audio latency in osu!, im gonna buy wired headphones and fix that after
